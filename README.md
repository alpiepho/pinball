# I/O Pinball (alpiepho fork)

When I showed this to some freinds I was challenged..."now you need to change it so the ball is the teams logo?".  Challenged Accepted.

This project is a fork of the original project (https://github.com/flutter/pinball) with a few additions:

- changed ball.png as challenged
- build with peanut script to host of gh-pages
- build as an installable PWA
- change the background screens to reflect the team

The run_peanut.sh script was particularly tricky...turns out that gh-pages does not like to serve assets with "__" in the url.

NOTE: I did disable the Google analytics.  And I don't think the global scoring will work.  A future option or another project, I will look into keeping common scores in Firebase as the origianl application does.


## Get Application
Version: 0.1

GH-Pages site: https://alpiepho.github.io/pinball/

or QR Code:

![QR Code](./qr-code.png)

## "Install" on iPhone

This application is a Web application known as a PWA (progressive web application).  It is possible to add a PWA to the home screen of an iPhone
like it is a downloaded application (there is a similare mechanism for Android that is not discused here).  Use the following steps:

1. Open the above link in Safari and click on up-arrow
2. Click on "Add to Home Screen"
3. Select "Add"

## TODO List

- [x] add todo list ot README
- [x] fix open source links
- [x] toggle sound (see Issues below)
- [x] allow i/info button from all screens, even when playing (pause game?)
- [x] debug mode from hidden press
- [ ] auto mode from hidden press
- [ ] can we add firebase to gh page? need login?

## Issues

- attempted to add sound mute.  works partially.  MUST disable BEFORE starting any games. Restart app to re-enable.

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:pinball/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```
